LICENSE GRANT\n\n1.1.1 Subject to the payment by the LICENSEE of the relevant charges and fees in respect of the Software licence, and the LICENSEE's compliance with the provisions of this SLA, the LICENSOR grants to the LICENSEE a perpetual, non-licensable non-exclusive, non-transferable licence as defined below (the \"Licence\").

This means:\n\nThe LICENSEE will need to purchase one licence for each Developer\nthe LICENSEE does not need to purchase licences for Build Servers or Testers; and\nif the LICENSEE's team grows, the LICENSEE will need to purchase additional licences.\nThe Licence grants the right to:\n\n(a) download and store the Software and Documentation.

This means that the Software can be installed on several Computers owned by the same Developer (as long as only one machine is used at a time);\n\n(b) use the Software as a component in developing LICENSEE's own desktop and/or mobile software applications, intranet sites and public websites (a \"LICENSEE Application\"); and\n\n(c) publish or redistribute the Software in compiled form only to End-Users and only as a complete Licence Application of the LICENSEE Application.\n\n(d) Unless expressly agreed otherwise, the Licence is granted solely for the Software object code.\n\n(e) The LICENSEE may purchase site-Licences that allow use of the Software for larger teams of developers at a single physical site (\"Site-Licences\"), or global licences that allow use of the Software for larger teams globally (\"Global-Licences\"), with Developer count and pricing agreed as part of the quoting and sales process.\n\n(f) Where applicable, the LICENSEE will have access to the Source Code of the Software excluding any Rendering Engine or further component not wholly part of the SciChart Charts software component module developed by the LICENSOR.\n\n(g) Develop applications pursuant to the appropriate licensing & activation being in place. With all downstream consumers of source-code compiled libraries having the relevant license type.\n\n(h) OEM and Runtime Fees. In most cases, the LICENSOR licenses the Software to the LICENSEE without runtime or OEM fees subject to compliance with the per-developer licensing model in 1.1.1. In some cases, where the LICENSEE is deriving significant commercial value from the Software, or deploying LICENSEE APPLICATIONS to very large user-bases, or certain deployment configurations such as uncapped licensing, the LICENSOR may require the LICENSEE to pay an annual runtime fee (\"OEM Fee\"), to be negotiated in good faith in line with the needs of the LICENSEE and LICENSOR. In the event that the Parties cannot agree the OEM Fee in good faith, the OEM Fee shall be determined by the LICENSOR exclusively acting reasonably. The LICENSOR reserves the right to waive the OEM Fee wholly or partially at the LICENSOR's sole and absolute discretion.\n\n(i) OEM and Runtime Fees (if applicable) confer additional benefits to enterprise customers the LICENSEE and may include items such as dedicated enhanced support, priority bug fixes, account management, and ensures the quality of the product, quality of service and longevity of service required for a world-class large-scale deployment in line with the needs of the LICENSEE entity.\n\n(j) The LICENSEE may copy and distribute the Software when embedded in LICENSEE Application so long as\n\nLICENSEE is not creating a substantially similar product or component to the Software, including but not limited to; wrapping the Software library in a wrapper for distribution to multiple developers / departments, creating a charting service, either for sale, or as part of an internal framework used by other developers in the LICENSEE's organisation; and\nEnd-Users are not Developers who will be debugging and developing against LICENSEE code.\nThese are both rare cases, but if LICENSEE is doing either of the above LICENSEE may need developer licences for each End-User, or a custom agreed licence type.\n \n\n1.1.2 The LICENSEE must not:\n\n(a) copy or reproduce the Software or Documentation or any part of the Software or Documentation other than in accordance with the licence granted in this Article 1;\n\n(b) sell, resell, rent, lease, loan, supply, distribute, redistribute, publish or re-publish the Software or Documentation or any part of the Software or Documentation, unless in accordance with Article 1.1.1 (b) and (c);\n\n(c) modify, alter, adapt, translate or edit, or create derivative works of, the Software or Documentation or any part of the Software or Documentation, for purpose of making a software product which is significantly similar to the Software;\n\n(d) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble the Software or Documentation or any part of the Software or Documentation;\n\n(e) circumvent or remove or attempt to circumvent or remove the technological measures applied to the Software and Documentation for the purposes of preventing unauthorised use, providing that nothing in this Article 1.1.2. will prohibit or restrict the LICENSEE or any other person from doing any act expressly permitted by applicable Law (including any act expressly permitted by Section 296ZA of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988);\n\n(f) distribute any part of the Source-Code if the LICENSEE has purchased a source-code licence;\n\n(g) make any attempt to interfere with the Rendering Engine in any way including reverse engineering, decompiling, modifying or redistributing aside from LICENSEE Application(s).

All Intellectual Property Rights in the Software and Documentation are and will remain, as between the Parties, the property of the LICENSOR.\n\n1.1.4. The LICENSEE must provide to the LICENSOR, or procure for the LICENSOR, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, reasonable evidence of compliance with the terms of this SLA. Such information will be treated with confidentiality as per ARTICLE 8.\n\n(a) This may be in the form of written statement of compliance signed by the LICENSEE, or an electronic licence audit report, stating compliance with the terms and conditions of the SLA, including but not limited to the number of licences held and the number of Developers using the Software or the commercial value derived from LICENSEE Application(s).\n\n(b) The LICENSOR reserves the right to track usage of the Software and ensure that the LICENSEE is complying with the terms of this SLA by sending small, anonymous telemetry to the LICENSOR's servers which include an identifier for the order & whether the software is being used at design time. To be used for the purpose of license auditing and retroactive billing where usage is exceeded. Licence audit telemetry data contains no identifiable data about the LICENSEE's users, developers, organisation, location, IP address or any other way to identify the End-User of the Software. An air-gapped (no telemetry) license-type can be negotiated as part of the purchasing process.\n\n1.2. OTHER USERS\n\n1.2.1 The LICENSEE may permit any employee or subcontractor of the LICENSEE to exercise the rights granted by the LICENSOR to the LICENSEE under Article 1.1.1., subject always to the restrictions set out in Article 1.1.2.\n\n1.2.2 The LICENSEE must ensure that any person using the Software and/or Documentation is made aware of, and agrees to, the terms of this SLA.\n\n1.3. UPDATES\n\n1.3.1 The LICENSEE may apply to the Software each Upgrade released by the LICENSOR and made available by the LICENSOR to the LICENSEE from time to time. All licences come with 1+ year Support & Updates subscription. .\n\nThis means:\n\nWhile your support subscription is active, LICENSEE will be entitled to receive support via LICENSOR website as per our support policy\n\nDuring the support & updates window, LICENSEE will be entitled to receive and use the latest version(s) of the Software that match LICENSEE's product keys.\n\nLICENSOR will have no obligation to provide technical support or bug fixes to LICENSEE who have not purchased support, or whose support has expired.\n\n1.3.2 The LICENSOR will have no obligation to provide support for the Software under Article 2 or repair or replace the Software under Article 2 in relation to any version of the Software that does not incorporate the most recent Upgrade to the Software.\n\n1.4.

LICENSEE Remedies. LICENSOR's entire liability and LICENSEE exclusive remedy shall be, at LICENSOR's option, either repair or replacement of the Software that does not meet LICENSOR's Limited Warranty during the warranty period. The Limited Warranty is void if failure of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse or misapplication or use in a manner not contemplated in the Software accompanying reference manuals and the present SLA. Any replacement of the Software shall be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period.\n\n3.3. The LICENSOR warrants to the LICENSEE that the LICENSOR has tested the Software for computer virus and other malicious third party software infections in accordance with standard industry practice.\n\n3.4. The LICENSEE acknowledges that:\n\n(a) Trial, Community or Beta Editions of the Software (Unpaid Editions) are made available free of charge on an \"AS IS\" basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the LICENSOR disclaims all express or implied warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. The LICENSEE understands and agrees that Unpaid Editions of the Software are made available free of charge \"AS IS\" and use of the Software is at the LICENSEE's own discretion and risk.\n\n(b) the Software may not be error-free and that non-material errors in the Software will not constitute a breach of this SLA;\n\n(c) the Software has not been developed to meet the specific requirements of the LICENSEE, and accordingly the LICENSEE will be responsible for ensuring that the Software is suitable to meet the LICENSEE's requirements.\n\n3.5. All of the Parties' liabilities and obligations in respect of the subject matter of this SLA are expressly set out herein. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no other terms concerning the subject matter of this SLA will be implied into this SLA or any related contract.\n\n3.6. NO OTHER WARRANTIES. LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

IN ANY CASE, LICENSOR' AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, UNDER ANY WARRANTY OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY LICENSEE UNDER THIS LICENCE.\n\n4.3. INDEMNITY. LICENSEE AGREES TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD LICENSOR, AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, AGENTS, CO-BRANDERS, ALLIANCE MEMBERS, OR OTHER PARTNERS, AND EMPLOYEES, HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIM OR DEMAND, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES, MADE BY ANY THIRD PARTY DUE TO OR ARISING OUT OF ANY LICENSEE APPLICATION, LICENSEE'S USE OF THE LICENSOR' SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ANY USE BY LICENSEE'S EMPLOYEES, LICENSEE'S VIOLATION OF THE PRESENT LICENSE AGREEMENT, OR LICENSEE'S VIOLATION OF ANY RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY.\n\nARTICLE 5 \u2013 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\nThe LICENSEE shall\n\n(a) follow all reasonable instructions that LICENSOR gives from time to time with regard to the use of the Intellectual Property Rights or other notice of ownership rights of LICENSOR or its suppliers; and\n\n(b) notify the LICENSOR immediately if the LICENSEE becomes aware of any unauthorised use of the whole or any part of the Software by any person.\n\nARTICLE 6 \u2013 TECHNICAL SUPPORT\nLICENSEE may subscribe technical support services at such charges and upon such terms and conditions as provided from time to time by LICENSOR to LICENSEE upon request.\n\nARTICLE 7 \u2013 EXPORT CONTROL\nThe following information is provided to LICENSEE for information purpose only. The LICENSOR shall bear no responsibility if the following information becomes inaccurate. Should LICENSEE desire to ship, transfer or export into any country the Software and/or the LICENSEE Application and its accompanying reference manuals, it shall be the responsibility of LICENSEE to obtain all consents and licences as may be required from time to time under the relevant laws, restrictions or regulations that may regulate such export.\n\nThe Software does not enter into any restricted categories (there is no Export Control Classification Number). The Export Classification Number for the Software is \"NLR\" which means \"No license requirement\". U.S. based LICENSEES of the Software distributing the LICENSEE Application worldwide should therefore use the acronym \"NLR\" to re-export the Software if the LICENSEE Application does not embed any other restricted technology. International embargo rules that apply to all products shall apply to re-export of the Software and export of LICENSEE Applications.\n\nARTICLE 8. CONFIDENTIALITY AND PUBLICITY\n8.1 Each Party shall, during the term of this SLA and thereafter, keep confidential all, and shall not use for its own purposes (other than implementation of this SLA) nor without the prior written consent of the other disclose to any third party (except its professional advisors or as may be required by any law or any legal or regulatory authority) any, information of a confidential nature (including trade secrets and information of commercial value) which may become known to such Party from the other Party and which relates to the other Party or any of its Affiliates, unless that information is public knowledge or already known to such Party at the time of disclosure, or subsequently becomes public knowledge other than by breach of this Licence, or subsequently comes lawfully into the possession of such Party from a third party. Each Party shall use its reasonable endeavours to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of any such information.\n\n8.2 SciChart shall have the right to disclose the existence and terms of this Agreement: (a) in any prospectus, offering memorandum, or other document required by law or securities regulations, (b) to any current or prospective investors, acquirers or collaborators (provided that any recipient of a disclosure under this subclause (b) shall be subject to appropriate obligations of confidentiality and non-use), or (c) as otherwise required by applicable law or regulation. SciChart shall have the right to use on its website the LICENSEE's logo, provided such use of the LICENSEE's logo is limited to statements of fact and the LICENSEE shall have the right to revoke permission of such use of the LICENSEE's logo at any time.\n\n8.3 Except as expressly stated in clause 8.2, neither Party, its employees or representatives shall use the name or logo of the other Party in any advertisement, press release, or other publicity without prior written consent of the other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).\n\nARTICLE 9. VARIATION\nSciChart has the right to vary the terms of this SLA and the relevant charges and fees in respect of the Licence from time to time. Existing LICENSEES with active subscriptions and existing commitments will be honoured by SciChart on existing terms for the duration of such LICENSEES' active subscriptions.\n\nARTICLE 10. DATA PROTECTION\nThe Parties undertake to comply with the provisions of the Data Protection Legislation and any related legislation in so far as the same relates to the provisions and obligations of this SLA.\n\nARTICLE 11. TERMINATION\n11.1 This SLA will terminate immediately and automatically if:\n\n(a) the LICENSEE: (i) is dissolved; (ii) ceases to conduct all (or substantially all) of its business; (iii) is or becomes unable to pay its debts as they fall due; (iv) is or becomes insolvent or is declared insolvent; or (v) convenes a meeting or makes or proposes to make any arrangement or composition with its creditors;\n\n(b) an administrator, administrative receiver, liquidator, receiver, trustee, manager or similar is appointed over any of the assets of the LICENSEE;\n\n(c) an order is made for the winding up of the LICENSEE, or the LICENSEE passes a resolution for its winding up.\n\nARTICLE 12. EFFECTS OF TERMINATION\n12.1 In the event that this SLA is terminated pursuant to clause 1.1.1 (breach by the LICENSEE), the LICENSEE will no longer be licensed to use the Software in LICENSEE Application(s) and must remove the Software from all version(s) of LICENSEE Applications(s) in a reasonable timescale. In this event, failure to cease using the Software shall make the LICENSEE liable to the LICENSOR for compensation (\"Additional Fee\") for using unlicensed Software, without prejudice to any other rights provided for by law or under this agreement, such as the right to claim damages in lieu of the Additional Fee.\n\n12.2 Upon termination any provision of this agreement that expressly or by implication is intended to come into or continue in force on or after termination or expiry of this agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n\n12.3 Termination of this SLA will not affect either party's accrued rights and liabilities.\n\n12.4 Save as expressly provided in this SLA, the LICENSEE will not be entitled to a refund upon the termination of this SLA.\n\nARTICLE 13. GENERAL\n13.1 NO WAIVER. No breach of any provision of this SLA will be waived except with the express written consent of the party not in breach.\n\n13.2. SEVERABILITY.

Save as expressly provided in this SLA, the LICENSEE must not assign, transfer, charge, license or otherwise dispose of or deal in this SLA and/or any its rights and/or obligations under this SLA.\n\n13.4 NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This SLA is made for the benefit of the Parties, and is not intended to benefit any third party or be enforceable by any third party. The rights of the Parties to terminate, rescind, or agree any amendment, waiver, variation or settlement under or relating to this SLA are not subject to the consent of any third party.\n\n13.5. FORCE MAJEURE. Under no circumstances shall either Party be held liable for failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement in case such failure is due to a Force Majeure event as defined in Preamble. The Party prevented by Force Majeure shall inform the other Party of the occurrence of the Force Majeure event within fifteen (15) days by written notice. Except as defined below, the Parties shall have no right to assert Force Majeure in order to terminate this Agreement.\n\nIf Force Majeure continues for a period of more than three (3) months from the date of the Force Majeure Declaration and has prevented either of the Parties from performing its obligations in whole or in part during that period, then either Party shall be entitled to terminate the SLA by written notice to the other Party.\n\nThe Parties shall have no right to claim for any compensation of liquidated damages to the other Party for delays or non-performance of the SLA by such Party in case of Force Majeure, even if the Force Majeure results in the termination of the SLA.\n\n13.6. RETROACTIVE BILLING. Through the use of Telemetry data, or licence audit, the LICENSOR generates usage reports. Where a LICENSEE exceeds the usage of their developer licenses or OEM license Fees (if applicable), the LICENSOR will provide a custom quote at renewal time for the subsequent year support subscription. Excessive mismatch between licenses purchased and usage may result in retroactive billing.\n\n13.7 NO AGENCY OR PARTNERSHIP. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNEES.
