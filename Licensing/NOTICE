PREAMBLE
SciChart Ltd is the entire legal and beneficial owner of, and has the exclusive right to grant licences and sub-licences, to the software known as SCICHART.

LICENSEE is willing to obtain and SciChart Ltd is willing to grant a non-exclusive licence under the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth for the sole purpose of integrating the Software into an application that LICENSEE has developed, under the terms and conditions of this SLA.

ARTICLE 1 – LICENSING OF THE SOFTWARE
1.1. LICENSE GRANT

1.1.1 Subject to the payment by the LICENSEE of the relevant charges and fees in respect of the Software licence, and the LICENSEE's compliance with the provisions of this SLA, the LICENSOR grants to the LICENSEE a perpetual, non-licensable non-exclusive, non-transferable licence as defined below (the "Licence"). THE LICENCE IS NOT UNCONDITIONALLY PERPETUAL AND SHALL TERMINATE IMMEDIATELY AND AUTOMATICALLY IF THE LICENSEE OR ANY EMPLOYEE OF THE LICENSEE OR PERSON AUTHORISED BY THE LICENSEE TO USE THE SOFTWARE AND/OR DOCUMENTATION BREACHES ANY PROVISION OF THIS SLA.

The Licence is granted per-Developer. This means:

The LICENSEE will need to purchase one licence for each Developer
the LICENSEE does not need to purchase licences for Build Servers or Testers; and
if the LICENSEE's team grows, the LICENSEE will need to purchase additional licences.
The Licence grants the right to:

(a) download and store the Software and Documentation. The Licence is per-Developer, not per machine. This means that the Software can be installed on several Computers owned by the same Developer (as long as only one machine is used at a time);

(b) use the Software as a component in developing LICENSEE's own desktop and/or mobile software applications, intranet sites and public websites (a "LICENSEE Application"); and

(c) publish or redistribute the Software in compiled form only to End-Users and only as a complete Licence Application of the LICENSEE Application.

(d) Unless expressly agreed otherwise, the Licence is granted solely for the Software object code.

(e) The LICENSEE may purchase site-Licences that allow use of the Software for larger teams of developers at a single physical site ("Site-Licences"), or global licences that allow use of the Software for larger teams globally ("Global-Licences"), with Developer count and pricing agreed as part of the quoting and sales process.

(f) Where applicable, the LICENSEE will have access to the Source Code of the Software excluding any Rendering Engine or further component not wholly part of the SciChart Charts software component module developed by the LICENSOR.

(g) Develop applications pursuant to the appropriate licensing & activation being in place. With all downstream consumers of source-code compiled libraries having the relevant license type.

(h) OEM and Runtime Fees. In most cases, the LICENSOR licenses the Software to the LICENSEE without runtime or OEM fees subject to compliance with the per-developer licensing model in 1.1.1. In some cases, where the LICENSEE is deriving significant commercial value from the Software, or deploying LICENSEE APPLICATIONS to very large user-bases, or certain deployment configurations such as uncapped licensing, the LICENSOR may require the LICENSEE to pay an annual runtime fee ("OEM Fee"), to be negotiated in good faith in line with the needs of the LICENSEE and LICENSOR. In the event that the Parties cannot agree the OEM Fee in good faith, the OEM Fee shall be determined by the LICENSOR exclusively acting reasonably. The LICENSOR reserves the right to waive the OEM Fee wholly or partially at the LICENSOR's sole and absolute discretion.

(i) OEM and Runtime Fees (if applicable) confer additional benefits to enterprise customers the LICENSEE and may include items such as dedicated enhanced support, priority bug fixes, account management, and ensures the quality of the product, quality of service and longevity of service required for a world-class large-scale deployment in line with the needs of the LICENSEE entity.

(j) The LICENSEE may copy and distribute the Software when embedded in LICENSEE Application so long as

LICENSEE is not creating a substantially similar product or component to the Software, including but not limited to; wrapping the Software library in a wrapper for distribution to multiple developers / departments, creating a charting service, either for sale, or as part of an internal framework used by other developers in the LICENSEE's organisation; and
End-Users are not Developers who will be debugging and developing against LICENSEE code.
These are both rare cases, but if LICENSEE is doing either of the above LICENSEE may need developer licences for each End-User, or a custom agreed licence type.
 

1.1.2 The LICENSEE must not:

(a) copy or reproduce the Software or Documentation or any part of the Software or Documentation other than in accordance with the licence granted in this Article 1;

(b) sell, resell, rent, lease, loan, supply, distribute, redistribute, publish or re-publish the Software or Documentation or any part of the Software or Documentation, unless in accordance with Article 1.1.1 (b) and (c);

(c) modify, alter, adapt, translate or edit, or create derivative works of, the Software or Documentation or any part of the Software or Documentation, for purpose of making a software product which is significantly similar to the Software;

(d) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble the Software or Documentation or any part of the Software or Documentation;

(e) circumvent or remove or attempt to circumvent or remove the technological measures applied to the Software and Documentation for the purposes of preventing unauthorised use, providing that nothing in this Article 1.1.2. will prohibit or restrict the LICENSEE or any other person from doing any act expressly permitted by applicable Law (including any act expressly permitted by Section 296ZA of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988);

(f) distribute any part of the Source-Code if the LICENSEE has purchased a source-code licence;

(g) make any attempt to interfere with the Rendering Engine in any way including reverse engineering, decompiling, modifying or redistributing aside from LICENSEE Application(s). The Licence herein granted conveys no right to grant sub-licences, except to the End-User of the LICENSEE Application subject to the payment of the OEM Fee, is not to be deemed transferable for any purpose and is indivisible and non-assignable except to a business successor of LICENSEE or with LICENSOR prior written approval.

1.1.3. All Intellectual Property Rights in the Software and Documentation are and will remain, as between the Parties, the property of the LICENSOR.

1.1.4. The LICENSEE must provide to the LICENSOR, or procure for the LICENSOR, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, reasonable evidence of compliance with the terms of this SLA. Such information will be treated with confidentiality as per ARTICLE 8.

(a) This may be in the form of written statement of compliance signed by the LICENSEE, or an electronic licence audit report, stating compliance with the terms and conditions of the SLA, including but not limited to the number of licences held and the number of Developers using the Software or the commercial value derived from LICENSEE Application(s).

(b) The LICENSOR reserves the right to track usage of the Software and ensure that the LICENSEE is complying with the terms of this SLA by sending small, anonymous telemetry to the LICENSOR's servers which include an identifier for the order & whether the software is being used at design time. To be used for the purpose of license auditing and retroactive billing where usage is exceeded. Licence audit telemetry data contains no identifiable data about the LICENSEE's users, developers, organisation, location, IP address or any other way to identify the End-User of the Software. An air-gapped (no telemetry) license-type can be negotiated as part of the purchasing process.

1.2. OTHER USERS

1.2.1 The LICENSEE may permit any employee or subcontractor of the LICENSEE to exercise the rights granted by the LICENSOR to the LICENSEE under Article 1.1.1., subject always to the restrictions set out in Article 1.1.2.

1.2.2 The LICENSEE must ensure that any person using the Software and/or Documentation is made aware of, and agrees to, the terms of this SLA.

(a) follow all reasonable instructions that LICENSOR gives from time to time with regard to the use of the Intellectual Property Rights or other notice of ownership rights of LICENSOR or its suppliers; and

(b) notify the LICENSOR immediately if the LICENSEE becomes aware of any unauthorised use of the whole or any part of the Software by any person.

ARTICLE 6 – TECHNICAL SUPPORT
LICENSEE may subscribe technical support services at such charges and upon such terms and conditions as provided from time to time by LICENSOR to LICENSEE upon request.

ARTICLE 7 – EXPORT CONTROL
The following information is provided to LICENSEE for information purpose only. The LICENSOR shall bear no responsibility if the following information becomes inaccurate. Should LICENSEE desire to ship, transfer or export into any country the Software and/or the LICENSEE Application and its accompanying reference manuals, it shall be the responsibility of LICENSEE to obtain all consents and licences as may be required from time to time under the relevant laws, restrictions or regulations that may regulate such export.

The Software does not enter into any restricted categories (there is no Export Control Classification Number). The Export Classification Number for the Software is "NLR" which means "No license requirement". U.S. based LICENSEES of the Software distributing the LICENSEE Application worldwide should therefore use the acronym "NLR" to re-export the Software if the LICENSEE Application does not embed any other restricted technology. International embargo rules that apply to all products shall apply to re-export of the Software and export of LICENSEE Applications.

ARTICLE 8. CONFIDENTIALITY AND PUBLICITY

Each Party shall use its reasonable endeavours to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of any such information.

8.2 SciChart shall have the right to disclose the existence and terms of this Agreement: (a) in any prospectus, offering memorandum, or other document required by law or securities regulations, (b) to any current or prospective investors, acquirers or collaborators (provided that any recipient of a disclosure under this subclause (b) shall be subject to appropriate obligations of confidentiality and non-use), or (c) as otherwise required by applicable law or regulation. SciChart shall have the right to use on its website the LICENSEE's logo, provided such use of the LICENSEE's logo is limited to statements of fact and the LICENSEE shall have the right to revoke permission of such use of the LICENSEE's logo at any time.

8.3 Except as expressly stated in clause 8.2, neither Party, its employees or representatives shall use the name or logo of the other Party in any advertisement, press release, or other publicity without prior written consent of the other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

ARTICLE 9. VARIATION

Existing LICENSEES with active subscriptions and existing commitments will be honoured by SciChart on existing terms for the duration of such LICENSEES' active subscriptions.

ARTICLE 12. EFFECTS OF TERMINATION

In this event, failure to cease using the Software shall make the LICENSEE liable to the LICENSOR for compensation ("Additional Fee") for using unlicensed Software, without prejudice to any other rights provided for by law or under this agreement, such as the right to claim damages in lieu of the Additional Fee.

12.2 Upon termination any provision of this agreement that expressly or by implication is intended to come into or continue in force on or after termination or expiry of this agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

12.3 Termination of this SLA will not affect either party's accrued rights and liabilities.

13.2. SEVERABILITY. If a provision of this SLA is determined by any court to be unlawful and/or unenforceable, the other provisions of this SLA will continue in effect. If any unlawful and/or unenforceable provision would be lawful or enforceable if part of it were deleted, that part will be deemed to be deleted, and the rest of the provision will continue in effect (unless that would contradict the clear intention of the Parties, in which case the entirety of the relevant provisions will be deemed to be deleted).

13.3 The LICENSOR may freely assign this SLA and/or its rights and/or obligations under this SLA without the LICENSEE's consent. Save as expressly provided in this SLA, the LICENSEE must not assign, transfer, charge, license or otherwise dispose of or deal in this SLA and/or any its rights and/or obligations under this SLA.

13.5. FORCE MAJEURE. Under no circumstances shall either Party be held liable for failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement in case such failure is due to a Force Majeure event as defined in Preamble. The Party prevented by Force Majeure shall inform the other Party of the occurrence of the Force Majeure event within fifteen (15) days by written notice. Except as defined below, the Parties shall have no right to assert Force Majeure in order to terminate this Agreement.

If Force Majeure continues for a period of more than three (3) months from the date of the Force Majeure Declaration and has prevented either of the Parties from performing its obligations in whole or in part during that period, then either Party shall be entitled to terminate the SLA by written notice to the other Party.

The Parties shall have no right to claim for any compensation of liquidated damages to the other Party for delays or non-performance of the SLA by such Party in case of Force Majeure, even if the Force Majeure results in the termination of the SLA.

13.6. RETROACTIVE BILLING. Through the use of Telemetry data, or licence audit, the LICENSOR generates usage reports. Where a LICENSEE exceeds the usage of their developer licenses or OEM license Fees (if applicable), the LICENSOR will provide a custom quote at renewal time for the subsequent year support subscription. Excessive mismatch between licenses purchased and usage may result in retroactive billing.
